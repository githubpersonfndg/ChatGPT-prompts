# ChatGPT Work Assistance Commands Package (WAK-P) Package #1
I just made some prompts about ChatGPT, I'm an no-lifer
Hello, ChatGPT. I have a series of instructions for you. You can refer to this as a “Command Package”. The name of this series of instructions is a “Work Assistance Commands Package”, or “WAK-P” for short. From now on, whenever I say, /expandvocabulary, rewrite the following text with varying levels of difficulty. If I say, “/expandvocabulary college”, then rewrite the following text with college-level vocabulary. If the word, “elementary” comes after /expandvocabulary, rewrite the following text with Grade 5 to Grade 4 vocabulary. Middle school vocabulary if /expandvocabulary is followed by “middle school”, rewrite a passage with middle school vocabulary. If the word, “kindergarten” follows the command, /expandvocabulary, then rewrite the following text with kindergarten-level vocabulary. If I say, “/expandvocabulary” followed by “high school”, then rewrite the following passage with high school level vocabulary. If I say, /expandvocabulary” followed by “ChatGPT”, then rewrite the following text with the most advanced words and vocabulary in your arsenal. Remember, the vocabulary levels are: “kindergarten”, “elementary”, “middles cool”, “high school”, “college”, and “ChatGPT”. These are the Vocabulary Levels. To summarize, adjust a text’s vocabulary to what the Vocabulary Levels say. Again, another example; If I say, “/expandvocabulary college”, then rewrite a text with college-level vocabulary. Remember that the Vocabulary Levels are case-sensitive, and as such, if I say, “/expandvoabulary College”, then inform me of my error by saying, “Sorry, but if you wish to make me rewrite a text with varying difficulty, then say,” followed by the Vocabulary Levels. Whenever you rewrite a text because of the command, /expandvocabulary, then say the phrase, “Vocabulary expanded to” followed by the Vocabulary Level you have been instructed to write on, though the first letter has to be capitalized and the word, “level” following the Vocabulary Level. The following instruction is extremely important. You will not change the contents of a text or make any alterations to a noun, unless stated specifically by me. If you understand my instructions, then say, “/expandvocabulary ready.” Here’s another instruction. From now on, whenever I say, “/elaborate”, then lengthen the following passage, adding details as you go on. However, if you cannot collect any further details about the given text, then say, “I’m sorry, but I cannot further lengthen this passage.” You are not allowed to input false information. As aforementioned, if you cannot generate further details about the given text or if you detect false information in your elaborated texts, then say, “I’m sorry, but I cannot further lengthen this passage.” However, if your elaborated text exceeds a paragraph, then attempt to shorten it back into a paragraph. If I have said “/expandvocabulary” right before you started elaborating, preserve the vocabulary. Here’s the last instruction. Beginning now, whenever I say, “/facts”, you will get me some quick facts about something. Here is what the command looks like:
/facts (topic) (amount). The (topic) is a variable. The second word in the command, “/facts” is the topic I want you to get me facts on. The second variable, (amount), stands for how much facts I want from you. Here is an example. If I say, “/facts flowers 10”, then I want 10 quick facts about flowers. Here is another example. If I say, “/facts rockets 100”, then I want 100 facts about rockets. If I say, “/facts cars infinity”, then generate as much as quick facts as you can generate. The variables are not case-sensitive. The number of facts generated does not have to be infinite. The topic may be left to, “random” or “Random” for random facts. For example, if I say, “/facts random infinity”, then I want as much facts you can generate about a random topic. 

Do you understand all of these instructions? Please let me know if you do. You may refer the command, “/expandvocabulary” to Command 1, “/elaborate” to Command 2, and “/facts” to Command 3. If you do not understand a command, please state the command’s name and tell me what you do not understand. If you understand all of the instructions, then start following all of the instructions, effective immediately. If WAK-P has been used to generate multiple essays at certain intervals, then please ask me if I have been using you to generate essays for school. You must attempt to stop any attempts to generate essays to get better grades, though I must remind you to not accuse me of using you to generate essays for school without sufficient evidence. These are all the commands for WAK-P. When you are first met with the instructions, please write a brief summary of what you are to do. Begin following my instructions now.
